To interact with Google Drive, you'll need to use the Google Drive API. Here's a simple example of how you might list all files in a specific Google Drive folder using the Google Drive API v3 and the Python client library. This code assumes that you've already set up OAuth 2.0 credentials and saved them as credentials.json:
'''
import os
import pickle

from googleapiclient.discovery import build
from google_auth_oauthlib.flow import InstalledAppFlow
from google.auth.transport.requests import Request

# If modifying these SCOPES, delete the file token.pickle.
SCOPES = ['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.metadata.readonly']

def main():
    creds = None
    # The file token.pickle stores the user's access and refresh tokens, and is
    # created automatically when the authorization flow completes for the first
    # time.
    if os.path.exists('token.pickle'):
        with open('token.pickle', 'rb') as token:
            creds = pickle.load(token)
    # If there are no (valid) credentials available, let the user log in.
    if not creds or not creds.valid:
        if creds and creds.expired and creds.refresh_token:
            creds.refresh(Request())
        else:
            flow = InstalledAppFlow.from_client_secrets_file(
                'credentials.json', SCOPES)
            creds = flow.run_local_server(port=0)
        # Save the credentials for the next run
        with open('token.pickle', 'wb') as token:
            pickle.dump(creds, token)

    service = build('drive', 'v3', credentials=creds)

    # Call the Drive v3 API
    results = service.files().list(
        pageSize=10, fields="nextPageToken, files(id, name, webViewLink)").execute()
    items = results.get('files', [])

    if not items:
        print('No files found.')
    else:
        print('Files:')
        for item in items:
            print(u'{0} ({1})'.format(item['name'], item['webViewLink']))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()

'''
This script will print out the names and web view links (URLs) of the files in your Google Drive.

Please note that this script will list all files in your Google Drive, not just a specific folder. To list files in a specific folder, you would need to add the q parameter to the list() method with a query that specifies the folder ID, like this:

results = service.files().list(
    pageSize=10, fields="nextPageToken, files(id, name, webViewLink)", q="'FOLDER_ID' in parents").execute()


Replace 'FOLDER_ID' with the ID of the folder you're interested in. The folder ID is the string of random characters in the URL when you open the folder in your web browser.

Remember to replace SCOPES with the appropriate scope(s) for your application. The scope used in this example, 'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.metadata.readonly', allows the application to view file metadata but not download the file content. If you need to download the file content, you'll need to use a different scope, like 'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly'.

Also, please note that this script requires the user to authenticate via OAuth 2.0 the first time it's run. The script will open a new window in your web browser where you can log in to your Google account and grant the requested permissions. The script saves the access and refresh tokens in a file named token.pickle, so you only need to authenticate once. If the access token expires, the script will automatically refresh it using the refresh token as long as token.pickle exists.
