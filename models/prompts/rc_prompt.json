How does George Orwell use animals to represent human characteristics in 'Animal Farm'? 4. What does the windmill symbolize in 'Animal Farm'? 5.

    "solutions": "1.  The main characters in 'Animal Farm' are Old Major, Napoleon, and Snowball. Old Major is a wise and respected pig who inspires the rebellion with his ideas of animal equality. Napoleon is another pig who becomes the leader of Animal Farm after the Rebellion. He gradually takes more power and becomes a dictator, mirroring the human farmer Mr. Jones. Snowball is a pig who is initially a leader of the rebellion and has many ideas for the farm's improvement. However, he is chased away by Napoleon and his guard dogs, allowing Napoleon to seize control of the farm. 2.  The main theme of 'Animal Farm' is that power can corrupt those who possess it. At the beginning of the story, the animals hope for a society where all animals are equal and no one has more power than anyone else. However, as the pigs take more control, they become more like the human farmers they overthrew, showing that power can lead to corruption and inequality. 3.  George Orwell uses animals to represent human characteristics and critique human behavior in 'Animal Farm'. Each animal represents a different type of human or idea. For example, the pigs represent those in power who abuse it, the horses represent the hardworking but naive lower classes, and the sheep represent the uninformed masses who can be easily swayed 4.  The windmill in 'Animal Farm' symbolizes the manipulation of the working class. Napoleon uses the windmill project to keep the other animals busy and to distract them from his increasing power and the decreasing living conditions. Even though the windmill is supposed to improve the farm, it brings more hardship to the animals, representing how those in power often exploit the working class. 5.  'Animal Farm' ends with the pigs becoming just like the humans they overthrew. They walk on two legs, wear clothes, and even drink alcohol. This signifies the failure of the rebellion and the complete corruption of the original ideals of Animal Farm. It shows that the pigs, who were once comrades to the other animals, have become indistinguishable from their former human oppressors, highlighting the theme of power's ability to corrupt.",
